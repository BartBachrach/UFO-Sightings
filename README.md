# UFO Sightings Around the World
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help NASA’s next web developer put together a webpage that contains data on UFO sightings, and allow users to find sightings based on specific criteria. There have been many UFO sightings throughout history, and in the 1950’s they began to be recorded. As of 2022 the United States Navy officially confirmed sightings of UFOs by its pilots, met with disappointingly little public interest. Anyway, the underlying importance of this analysis was to get comfortable building dynamic web pages with embedded links to JSON data files and JavaScript code scripts to make the page come alive. To support the html text that builds the web page, we also learned how to deploy CSS files to further add style and flair to the web page to make it stand out to NASA recruiters and further enhance our young upstart’s chances of landing a job there. 

## Results
A web page like this could be used as an open source place for people to gather data of their own. In our case we have UFO data that is relatively small in the context of the world of data, but it is a solid case study on how to build a page like this and how it might be used. With a data set ten or a hundred times bigger, you could do some very precise filtering to extract exactly what one might be looking  for. For example, in our data set, it is simply too small to do very precise, random searches, but an example would be finding UFO sightings in Benton, Arkansas on 1/1/2010. ![This is an image](https://github.com/BartBachrach/UFO-Sightings/blob/main/Challenge_Screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-29%20at%201.20.28%20PM.png) If the data was about car accidents or crime, there would be ample data to do a search with every, or almost every, search field with specific criteria. However, with the UFO data set, a user can still find every sighting in the data set where an individual saw a triangle shaped object, or all the sightings in California, USA. ![This is an image](https://github.com/BartBachrach/UFO-Sightings/blob/main/Challenge_Screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202022-05-29%20at%202.09.33%20PM.png)
In the above image, all the triangle-shaped UFOs observed could have all been the same, real, otherwordly spacecraft, but that is for the user to decide, and thus is what makes this website and UFO spotting so interesting. Furthermore, it may get the general public in the mind to search out data on their own and draw their own conclusions.  

To use search criteria, the user simply enters the criteria of their choosing, in this case the options are date, city, state, country, and shape. Any combination of those search parameters will filter the data set and return any matches it finds. Again, with our limited-size dataset, that can be tricky, but with a data set of hundreds or thousands or hundreds OF thousands of entries, a user could narrow down the data they’re looking for to perhaps ten or twenty items. A user interface such as this would best be deployed for an open source database. 

## Summary
One drawback of this design is that it is limited to the dataset embedded in the html file, so while the web page is dynamic and filters search criteria, the data itself is static, and includes no way of retrieving updated data on UFO sightings. The first recommendation this web designer has is to add in a function for users to enter their own UFO sightings and add it to the preexisting data. And because no one can independently verify a UFO sighting, all sightings would be valid. 

Another recommendation for this design would be to include news about UFO’s since it has now been officially confirmed that military pilots have encountered actual unidentified flying objects that seem to defy the laws of physics as we know it. The most direct way to do so would be to deploy a web scraping program to pull UFO-related articles to add to the information about individuals’ self-reported UFO sightings.
